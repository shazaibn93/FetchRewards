# FetchRewards


Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to go through this quick app. I tried to do as much as I can in 48 hours.

I used solely python and flask to build this app. There is some html, jinja2, and css also. I didn't use a db server. 

*Please use the nav bar to navigate this web app*

1. Transactions Tab - Enter some transactions, they will display right under the transactions form
2. Sum Tab - You can go to the next tab and see the total amount of points earned
3. Totals by Payee Tab - You can view the total points for each payee
4. Spend Tab - Enter an amount of points (please enter an amount less than the total points). The app will spend points based on oldest transactions and return the remaining balances of each payee.

I really enjoyed this exercise and would like to thank you for your time and the opportunity regardless of whether we move forward or not :)
